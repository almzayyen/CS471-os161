1. If the residents of Podunk follow the first arrive, first exit method for handling the 
intersection, this intersection would be handled by using a queue, tracking the order
in which cars arrive at the intersection. The car at the head of the queue would acquire
the lock to the intersection, ensuring that no other car could proceed through the 
intersection while they were, once out they would release the lock allowing the next car
to enter the intersection. This method is suboptimal because, while it avoids any issues
with collisions or issues with starvation or deadlock, it is not the most effective method
as only one car can be moving at a time, while it is easily possible for all directions 
to make a right turn simultaneously. This one at a time first come method is safe, but 
far slower than ideal.

2. One instance of car behavior that could result in deadlock would be in the event that
there were four cars arriving at the same time, one from each direction, all wanting to 
make a left turn, all would begin this turn and be blocked by one of the other cars in 
the intersection, all unable to move.
